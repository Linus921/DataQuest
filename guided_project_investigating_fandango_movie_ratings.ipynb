    "## Guided Project: Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to follow up and see if Fandango's moving ratings are still biased.   In October 15, a data journalist Walt Hickey uncovered that Fandango was showing higher ratings that what thea actual ratings were.  He was able to see the rating shown to viewers and the actual rating from the webpage.   He then did an analysis and discovered rounding errors which augmented the actual true movie ratings.   This bias was blamed on a system error and was said to be fixed by the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to perform an investgation and see if there is still bias at Fandango."

    "One of the best ways to figure out whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis is to compare the system's characteristics previous and after the analysis. Fortunately, we have ready-made data for both these periods of time:\n",

    "#### Population Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. The population of interest for our analysis is made of all the movie ratings stored on Fandango's website, regardless of the releasing year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to find out whether the parameters of this population changed after Hickey's analysis, we're interested in sampling the population at two different periods in time — previous and after Hickey's analysis — so we can compare the two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we're working with was sampled at the moments we want: one sample was taken previous to the analysis, and the other after the analysis. We want to describe the population, so we need to make sure that the samples are representative, otherwise we should expect a large sampling error and, ultimately, wrong conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Hickey's article and from the README.md of the data set's repository, we can see that he used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",
    "The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample — some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md of the data set's repository):\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",
    "The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the README.md or from the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "This second sample is also subject to temporal trends and it's unlikely to be representative of our population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these authors had certain research questions in mind when they sampled the data, and they used a set of criteria to get a sample that would fit their questions. Their sampling method is called purposive sampling (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us."

    "## Changing the Goal of our Analysis\n",
    "At this point, we can either collect new data or change our the goal of our analysis. We choose the latter and place some limitations on our initial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis, our new goal is to determine whether there's any difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. This new goal should also be a fairly good proxy for our initial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Isolating the Samples We Need\n",
    "With this new research goal, we have two populations of interest:\n",
    "All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2015.\n",
    "All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2016.\n",
    "We need to be clear about what counts as popular movies. We'll use Hickey's benchmark of 30 fan ratings and count a movie as popular only if it has 30 fan ratings or more on Fandango's website.\n",
    "Although one of the sampling criteria in our second sample is movie popularity, the sample doesn't provide information about the number of fan ratings. We should be skeptical once more and ask whether this sample is truly representative and contains popular movies (movies with over 30 fan ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick way to check the representativity of this sample is to sample randomly 10 movies from it and then check the number of fan ratings ourselves on Fandango's website. Ideally, at least 8 out of the 10 movies have 30 fan ratings or more."

    "\n",
    "- Both distributions are strongly left skewed.\n",
    "- The 2016 distribution is slightly shifted to the left relative to the 2015 distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left skew suggests that movies on Fandango are given mostly high and very high fan ratings. Coupled with the fact that Fandango sells tickets, the high ratings are a bit dubious. It'd be really interesting to investigate this further — ideally in a separate project, since this is quite irrelevant for the current goal of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slight left shift of the 2016 distribution is very interesting for our analysis. It shows that ratings were slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that there was a difference indeed between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. We can also see the direction of the difference: the ratings in 2016 were slightly lower compared to 2015.\n",

    "## Comparing Relative Frequencies\n",
    "It seems we're following a good thread so far, but we need to analyze more granular information. Let's examine the frequency tables of the two distributions to analyze some numbers. Because the data sets have different numbers of movies, we normalize the tables and show percentages instead."
